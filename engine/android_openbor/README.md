# hello-sdl2-android

This project is an update of the hello world project here https://github.com/stephen47/android-sdl2-gradle-template, as I couldn't find a good way to integrate a CMake built C++ project to an android application.
It features a sample hello world using SDL and SDL_image.

The project has now been restructured to use a simple flow. To use it, simply open `android` as a project in Android Studio. Compiling and running should work out of the box.
